# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create a website to hold the information that I learned in my course prework.

I built this project to help me retain the information that I learned building while building this website.

Creating a website that can also be used as a study guide helped me understand the steps of building the website by breaking it down into each major section of code that was needed and making notes on key learning points for each topic.

I learned many different fundamentals of coding that when put together, helped me build a simple website that can also serve as notes for the prework project I completed.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. 

In the Prework Study Guide, each section contains notes about each topic that I learned about( HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.) When you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript that was used in this project running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework and choose one topic for us to study first.


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
