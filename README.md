# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create a website to hold the information that I learned in my course prework.

I built this project to help me retain the information that I learned building while building this website.

Creating a website that can also be used as a study guide helped me understand the steps of building the website by breaking it down into each major section of code that was needed and making notes on key learning points for each topic.

I learned many different fundamentals of coding that when put together, helped me build a simple website that can also serve as notes for the prework project I completed.

## Usage

In the Prework Study Guide, each section contains notes about each topic that I learned about( HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.) When you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript that was used in this project running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
